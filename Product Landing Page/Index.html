                    About Big Buck Bunny
                </p>
                <p>
                    A recently awoken enormous and utterly adorable fluffy rabbit is heartlessly harassed by a flying squirrel's gang of rodents who are determined to squash his happiness.

                    Big Buck Bunny (code-named Project Peach) is a 2008 short (10 minutes) computer-animated comedy film featuring animals of the forest, made by the Blender Institute, part of the Blender Foundation. Like the foundation's previous film, Elephants Dream, the film was made using Blender, a free and open source software application for 3D computer modeling and animation made by the same foundation. Unlike that earlier project, the tone and visuals departed from a cryptic story and dark visuals to one of comedy, cartoons, and light-heartedness.

                    The film was officially released in an April 10, 2008 premiere in Amsterdam while online movie downloads and files were released on May 30, 2008.

                    High-resolution and stereoscopic versions of the film were released in 2013 by Janus Kristensen. The film was followed up with an open game titled Yo Frankie!, in August 2008.

                    The main character (called Big Buck Bunny) was also used in short films created by Renderfarm.fi: What is Renderfarm.fi? (2011) telling about the advantages of render farms and BBB loves CC (2012) promoting Creative Commons licences. The bunny's voice was given by Jan Morgenstern, who was the composer of a Big Buck Bunny movie soundtrack.
