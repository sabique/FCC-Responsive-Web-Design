                    <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, 
                        chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. 
                        She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first 
                        algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to 
                        recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and one of the first computer programmers.</p>

                    <p>Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, 
                        Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. 
                        Ada described her approach as "poetical science" and herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".</p>

                    <p>When she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow 
                        British mathematician Charles Babbage, also known as "the father of computers", and in particular, Babbage's work 
                        on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, 
                        Mary Somerville.</p>

                    <p>Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, 
                        supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the 
                        first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this 
                        perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the 
                        engine.[10] Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision of the 
                        capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, 
                        focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical 
                        Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.</p>

                    <p>
                        She died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36. :(
